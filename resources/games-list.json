      "description": "A UK alternate-timeline RPG based on the miniseries of comics by Bryan Talbot. The titular hero is a man with the unique ability to jump between parallel universes. He is recruited by a telepath named Rose Wylde to become an agent of the parallel known as \"zero-zero\" - whose stable position in the multiverse has allowed the development of world peace. They fight an organization called the Disruptors who are trying to destabilize the multiverse. The system is a percentile skill-based system similar to Chaosium's Basic Roleplaying. Resolution uses a universal table that converts skill, difficulty and a percentile roll into level of success from best (A) to least (E). Character creation is random-roll, with different rolls for the percentile stats. Strength is 4D10+20; Endurance is 4D10+30; Willpower is 6D10+10; PSI-rating is a straight D100 roll; etc. The player adds Intellect + Willpower + (age multiplied by ten) to get the number of points to spend on skills. Some skills have a default, and some get a First Point bonus (a bonus only if at least 1 point is spent on them). Character generation includes the option for the GM to designate one player character with a PSI ability, and for one player character to have a Warrior Option that significantly boosts points.",

You get attribute increases when you turn 16, 17 and 18. You then randomly generate problems, ranging from \"Moderate Acne\" to phobias and so forth, with increased problems for lower Appearance. You have initial skills based on class, including high-school specific skills such as Cheating, Drinking, Studying, and Crudeness.

The resolution is standard roll d20 under attribute+skill, with a twist. Rather than fixed modifiers, the roll is modified by a second step-die which varies (i.e. -d4, +d4, +d6, +d8, etc.). Experience is divided into levels, but experience can be divided freely among skills. It also covers aliens (5 types), starships, psionics, mutations, and equipment to varying degrees. \nSettings include \"Star*Drive\"; \"Dark*Matter\" (conspiracy); and \"Gamma World\" (based on the earlier game).",

Character creation is a mix of point-based and random-roll, and there is only one core attribute - Virility. All PCs have a Virility of 3. The players then split 25 points between the secondary stats Dangerous and Attractive, which are spent to take actions in fighting or seduction (respectively), and are lost by being being wounded or refused. Players roll 1d6 each for their initial pools of Aggro and Horny points that can be spent for bonus dice. They select 7 tricks - one-shot abilities such as \"double strike\" or \"electrifying touch\".

The players then split 25 points between the secondary stats Dangerous and Attractive, which are spent to take actions in fighting or seduction (respectively), and are lost by being being wounded or refused. Players roll 1d6 each for their initial pools of Aggro and Horny points that can be spent for bonus dice.

It is populated by various races including the ancient and mystical Vata, the Sea-folk; the Night People; and the Rhydan (psychic intelligent animals). The rules are a standalone system (the \"True20\" system) loosely based on the D20 System used by 3rd edition D&D, adding in rules variations from Mutants & Masterminds. There are only three core classes: adept, expert, and warrior -- and variety instead comes from more and more variety of feats. It also includes a wound track damage system based on a 1d20 roll to resist damage, and a new magic system based on feats, where spells cost fatigue. The combat system is modified to remove full-round attacks and attacks of opportunity, and adding some non-attack options.",

These can be made by gluing printed icon sheets onto dice, marking on blank dice, or simulated with a computerized dice roller utility. Each die has icons such as \"Universal Success\", \"Physical Success\", \"Mental Success\", \"Universal Hindrance\", \"Damage\", and many icons for skills, magic, and special circumstances. Action resolution is by rolling your set of dice and counting applicable success icons, compared to the result of Challenge dice (if unopposed) or the opposed entity's dice (if opposed). Challenge dice have 2 out of 6 faces as \"Null\" which cancels one success. Character creation is open point-based of a sort: the player chooses icons for his four starting dice. One face is always \"Universal Success\", and one face is either \"Physical Success\" or \"Mental Success\", while the other four are freely chosen from the other choices.",

The size of die (d4 through d12) is limited by the combination of your profile and the Approach you use (which is one of Violent, Strategic, Tactical, or Peaceful).

Character creation uses classes such as fighters, wizards, and other common types. Characters may include Portuguese bandeirantes, native scouts, miracle-working Jesuits, native shamans, Yoruba medium-priests, and even Hermetic European \"warlocks\".

The game includes a number of monsters including native beasts such as the anhangüera (demon-possessed fire-breathing animals), kanaíma (cannibals reincarnated as werejaguars) and jurupari (nightmare spirits who strangle people in their sleep), as well as more prosaic fare -- vampires, werewolves, mermaids and even the Devil itself. There are at least three sourcebooks: \"A Floresta do Medo/O Engenho\" (two adventures); \"Os Quliombos da Lua\" (setting expansion, detailing a fortress deep in the wilderness built by rebel african slaves); and \"O Vale dos Acritós\" (detailing the region of the savage giant native Acritós and their culture).",

Each character designates one trade each as Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary. The priority determines a multiplier: x6 for Primary, x5 for Secondary, and x4 for Tertiary. Action resolution is by adding attribute + skill, multiplying by trade multiplier, adding difficulty modifier, and then rolling under that number on percentile dice. In combat, a hit roll is by a roll modified by targets avoid percentage -- followed by hit location and damage (using d6s) upon success. Character creation is a mix of random-roll and point-buy, where skill points can be used to modify the results of random rolls for race, social class, handedness, and attributes. Remaining skill points are used to buy skills within the three groupings.",

Each player creates a human and also a Fae, and each player's Fae must connect to another player's human. Play proceeds in scenes, where there is a defined spotlight character whose success in the scene is determined by bidding dice (d6s). Players spend dice to get what they want, and get dice by giving control to the Fae (aka \"geis\"). Geis are phrased as compulsions and abstentions that the character must follow. Human character creation is by defining four Elements (Head, Heart, Life, and Loins), at least 2 Goals, and 6 Supports (i.e. things important to the character). Fae creation is by answering three questions: \"Who are you?\", \"What do you want?\" and \"What makes you weak?\"",

If greater, you succeed automatically, but otherwise you draw a playing card. If it is a number card less than your total you add +1, and if it is a face card there are special results. Character creation is limited point-based: distribute 30 points among 12 attributes, and 30 points among skills and advantages. The second edition uses the \"Tri-Stat\" system from Big Eyes, Small Mouth. The third edition uses a step die system, where you add attribute number plus skill number plus a die roll versus a fixed difficulty of 9. The die rolled varies with difficulty, from a d20 for easy tasks to a d4 for nearly impossible ones. Third edition character creation is limited point-based, with 14 attribute points and 9 occupation points. Occupations vary in cost based on breadth, and have three ranks (Rookie, Professional, and Veteran).",

Each is rated from d4 to d12, and player-defined particular strengths are added as modifiers. Resolution is handled by highest die of two Forms plus modifiers, and the winner may impose penalties on the loser -- but the result in-fiction must be agreed on by both players.",

The game had three related combat systems: jousting, hand-to-hand, and melee. Combat resolution worked by both players secretly selecting one of 10 maneuver cards. Comparing cards gave a target number to hit on 1d100, where the figure with higher Prowess adds the difference to his roll. Damage is based on the action and the difference between the roll and target. The game also included a description of the code of chivalry, some encounter tables, and rules for falling in love.

It uses a d6-based rules system, where action resolution is skill plus 2d6 vs difficulty (with some complications for combat). Character creation is point-based: pick one of two broad classes (\"learned\" and \"practical\"), and then spend starting experience points on attributes and skills.

The cost varies depending on skill and class, and starting rank is randomly determined as a 1d6 roll. There is a magic system with five types of magic, each of which work differently. The core rulebook is a oversize black hardback (30 by 19 by 3 cm), with a bookmark ribbon sewn in, and embossed logo of a crowned horse on the spine and back.

It has no single official setting, but the core book features three sample settings: a surreal post-modern setting (inspired by The Big O), a standard sci-fi setting (inspired by Gundam), and a tongue-in-cheek high school mecha setting. Game sessions are broken into short Episodes that take about a half hour. Each Episode starts with a role-playing scene centered on a single player who makes a roll, where success grants a bonus in the coming battle. This is followed by a mecha battle conducted on a bullseye map. If a player faces defeat, retreat is automatically successful unless the player chooses to risk their character's life.",

A radiation storm causes mutations to occur to its occupants creating outlandish mutated humans and animals. The concept was wandering around the interior encountering strange creatures in a dungeon-like way -- including many concepts that would later surface in Gamma World. The second edition in 1994 was a universe book of this setting for the Amazing Engine game system. The third and fourth edition use their own system, referred to as the 3d6 system. Resolution uses a universal table of attribute with difficulty to find a target number for a 3d6 roll. Combat also uses a table that compares weapon class number (from 21 to 3) and armor class number (from 21 to 2). Character creation is primarily random roll, with varying rules for robots, androids, and humans.",

After character creation, players and GM collectively create the setting by drawing a map and marking it with each character's d20 trait and adding features related to these. Play proceeds by scenes that the GM creates and the players add details to. Resolution is by taking the highest result of rolling all dice that apply, compared to a difficulty (default 4) or opposed roll. Foregoing a d20 roll can earn the player a reroll token.",

      "description": "A hilarious dark future comedy game, where characters are pawns of an out-of-control Computer in a post-nuclear-apocalypse complex. The atmosphere is on black comedy and slapstick, with the notable feature that each character has 5 clone backups -- such that they can die multiple times (and they usually do). 1st edition used a percentile skill system with skill trees. 2nd edition completely revised this. The XP edition again majorly revised the rules, eliminating attributes in favor of six skill groups (Management, Stealth, Violence, Hardware, Software, Wetware). Action resolution is roll under skill on 1d20, with chances modified by \"Perversity Points\" which are spent before the roll to modify the chance.",

      "description": "An urban fantasy game where the player characters are humans who were once mortal, but received the Spark that transformed them into minor deities. Each god has a Dominion - i.e. what they are a god of - as well as specialized skills within that subject, called Manifestations. They also become connected to a territory that is influenced by the Dominion. So a goddess of liquor would have a territory that developed more alcoholics. The gods are divided into \"Theologies\" - widespread groups sharing a purpose or theme, such as the Ascendants who want to become as powerful as the old gods, or the Cult of the Saints who believe they were sent from Heaven. They also form into local pantheons, who have shared or overlapping territory. Resolution uses a simplified variant of the \"Dynamic Gaming System\" from from Apocalypse Prevention, Inc. by the same author. The core mechanic is 1d20 + Attribute + Skill vs. a Target Number of 10, 20, 30, or 40. Characters creation is limited point-based, including both human stats (25 points in six attributes and 25+IQ points in skills) as well as godly stats.",

The cover is a scene from \"Alice in Wonderland\", with scenes from other famous works done for interior illustrations. It uses a distant variant of the D20 System from 3rd edition D&D. There are no classes or levels. Rather, character creation is template-based. All characters must choose one culture (Arab, Asian, Easterner, frontiersman, native or Westerner) and one caste, their social class (slave, servant, freeman, bourgeois, noble or royal). Advancement is by \"creative energy points\", which are used to buy new advantages. There is no combat bonus. Rather, there is a Combat skill, with three sub-skills: Attack, Defend, and Initiative. Damage is done by the difference between attack roll and defense roll, modified by weapon and armor. It also includes \"plot points\" which can be spent to control narration.",

Combat is categorized in four different ways for personal combat (fist, knife, sword and gun) and ship combat (pursuit, ranged, guns, and boarding). Combat has options for escalation and increased consequences. In character generation, players answer a series of questions by choosing from lists of options, which generates a small collection of statistics for sins, suffering, ambitions and gear.

It uses a skill-based system, with resolution by 3d6 + attribute + skill compared to a difficulty (13 for an average action). There are six attributes (rated 1-6), and broad skills (rated 1-3) like \"gladiator\" or \"noble\". Character creation is a mix of random-roll, priority picks, and lifepath.",

The premise is that all ugly people were declared mutants and locked in the sewers, and since radioactive waste was also dumped there, soon there were even more hideous genuine mutants. There are eight strains of mutant: Bloaters (overweight and bloated humanoids), Bugs (insectoid monstrosities), Furries (humanoid animals prized as slaves by kinky folks), Goops (big balls of boneless slime), Hissies (reptilian mutants), Psychos (big-brained mutants with a knack for psychic powers), Skinbags (incredibly skinny mutants whose skin sags around them like some sort of cloak) and Sushi (fish people). There are a large assortment of humorous mutations described. Action resolution is to roll (skill) d10's and take the best, then add attribute. Character creation is either random-roll or selected.",

The winner of the scene is the one who rolls the highest number on the dice. If you are possessed by the Roach, you roll a massive d12. However, if you end the game possessed by the Roach, you lose. To lose it, you have to regurgitate the Roach, by subliming away something you care about, which makes your dice weaker. The game comes with a packet of 40 cards and a rubber cockroach.",

Play is largely freeform, using a set of scribbled notes and a board containing nine fields that an object is moved between.

The core rulbook is staple-bound with only a large purple gas giant and space background on the cover, and no interior illustrations. The rules are split into a \"Basic Game\" using pre-generated characters from the series, and an \"Advanced Game\" with full character creation and additional combat rules like random initiative. Characters have six attributes (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Charisma, Luck, and Mentality) generated by 3d6 rolls modified by race. There is a \"Hand-to-Hand Class\" bonus, but no other skills and no experience rules. Melee combat is resolved in a single damage step. The attacker rolls 1d6-6d6 (depending on weapon) plus Strength, Dexterity, and Hand-to-Hand Class modifiers. The defender subtracts 1d6 plus Luck and Hand-to-Hand Class modifiers from this total to determine damage. Ranged combat requires a 1d6 roll under a hit number which depends on range and the attacker's Dexterity. The rules include sheets for bridge crew including Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Uhura, Checkov, Sulu, Chapel, and Scott as well as M'res and Arex from the Star Trek animated series. The advanced rules include descriptions of several alien races including Larry Niven's Kzin, an extensive equipment list, tables for randomly-generated aliens, and two introductory scenarios.

It uses a percentile skill system where every skill and attribute roll is an opposed roll, where you subtract a percentile roll from modified skill level to determine the effectiveness (EF) of the attempt. The EF is compared to an opposed roll to see if they succeed. This may be modified by a related skill roll (\"tweaking\") or spending a limited number of luck points. Characters are created by a random-roll class-based system. The player rolls for the race of the character, where the races are different genetically engineered versions of humanity. Primary attributes are then generated with dice rolls based on the race. The player then rolls education level based on a chart, and chooses a profession from 5 options: Special Tactics Officer (STO), Corporate Spy (C-Spy), Nano-Tech, Med-Tech and Psi-Tech. Skills are then bought with points based on education level and profession. There are two types of skills: main skills (worth 5 points per level) and sub-skills, which are multipliers of the main skill total. It also has a personality system where characters have defined \"passions\" that trigger possible disillusionment with the social order (i.e. \"A civilian is about to be killed - do I save them and lose the plans?\"). Triggered attitude checks may make the character more disillusioned with the system, making it harder go up ranks and get new technology but granting an experience bonus. Besides the game system book, the core game also has a Tech Manual (covering various equipment) and The Defense Zone Manual (GM's guide).",

It is an open secret that the office run by transcendental artificial intelligences spread throughout time, who are trying to save humanity to ease their loneliness. Character creation is by rating four player-chosen core values (rated 0-10) representing what they believe in, and also Capabilities (rated 1-10) representing the five kinds of technology built into their bodies (rated 1-10): Biotech, Cognitech, Metatech, Nanotech, and Stringtech. Higher ratings in Capabilities result in greater complications and fewer levels in the story-level abilities -- the six Themes: Plot Immunity, Intrigue, Empathy, Magnetism, Comprehension, and Romance. The player spends from 5 to 9 levels among the Themes. The player also spends points up to two times (Biotech plus Cognitech) among professions (i.e. broad skills). Resolution is by multiplying Capability and a 1d10 roll, and also Profession and a 1d10 roll, taking the higher result. A relevant Core Value adds +1 or +2 to the roll. Players may spend one Twist per session to activate a Theme, with an effect depending on the Theme type and level. More Twists can be gained by taking Complications.",

Action resolution is by drawing a number of cards equal to the appropriate trait, and taking the highest. The GM draws cards either based on task difficulty (1 to 10) or based on NPC stat. Each failure on a player's part adds a grievance, and if grievances are greater than the Essence stat, the character is effectively out of the scene. Flair can be gained by good descriptions, and creates a pool of points which can be spent to hold onto a high card for later use, or move the game to a chosen scene.

There are two teams of players: prosecution and defense. Character creation begins by distributing 18 points among six attributes: Authority, Jibe, Charm, Investigation, Violence, and Composure. They then pick two +1 traits, one +2 trait, one merit and one flaw. Player characters then choose teams and create a defendant by a series of random rolls for sex, age, and profession. Play follows with an explicit order of play for the arrest and court case. Actions can include legal maneuvers as well as assaulting an opponent, intimidating witnesses, seducing key figures, and more. Core resolution is by rolling 1d6 and adding stats and special bonuses, compared to a difficulty or opposed roll - called the \"Beer and Crisps\" system.",

Magic has always existed in our world, though mostly hidden because it has backed oppressed classes such as poor blacks and Latinos. Magic has recently gained press and publicity during the rise of rap and hip-hop, as the gang slingers became popular and brought their knowledge of the streets and magic to a broader audience. Character creation uses freeform Traits, two positive and two negative, to indicate things your character is good at or bad at. You are given a broad-range Skill to cover things your character has proficiency in. You have at least one Ally, one Enemy, one Lover, and one Rival. Action resolution is based on 3d6, plus extra dice for traits. The player rolls and keeps the highest three (for positive traits) or lowest three (for negative traits). The dice are then assigned to three categories: Order (how fast you execute, i.e. initiative), Power (how effective you are at achieving your goal), and Payback (a gift from the Wyrd, giving benefits such as healing, not being damaged in the first place, more success on your next magical action, or a nifty magical effect on your next mundane action).",
