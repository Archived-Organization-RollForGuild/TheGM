      "description": "A UK alternate-timeline RPG based on the miniseries of comics by Bryan Talbot. The titular hero is a man with the unique ability to jump between parallel universes. He is recruited by a telepath named Rose Wylde to become an agent of the parallel known as \"zero-zero\" - whose stable position in the multiverse has allowed the development of world peace. They fight an organization called the Disruptors who are trying to destabilize the multiverse. The system is a percentile skill-based system similar to Chaosium's Basic Roleplaying. Resolution uses a universal table that converts skill, difficulty and a percentile roll into level of success from best (A) to least (E). Character creation is random-roll, with different rolls for the percentile stats. Strength is 4D10+20; Endurance is 4D10+30; Willpower is 6D10+10; PSI-rating is a straight D100 roll; etc. The player adds Intellect + Willpower + (age multiplied by ten) to get the number of points to spend on skills. Some skills have a default, and some get a First Point bonus (a bonus only if at least 1 point is spent on them). Character generation includes the option for the GM to designate one player character with a PSI ability, and for one player character to have a Warrior Option that significantly boosts points.",

You pick one of seven classes: Average Kid, Brain, Cheerleader, Criminal, Jock, Tough, and Loser. You then generate your social level based upon your class and a d10 roll, which in turn generates your starting money and allowance. Your age (from 13 to 17) and birthday are then generated. You get attribute increases when you turn 16, 17 and 18. You then randomly generate problems, ranging from \"Moderate Acne\" to phobias and so forth, with increased problems for lower Appearance. You have initial skills based on class, including high-school specific skills such as Cheating, Drinking, Studying, and Crudeness.

Contact is interrupted by a catastrophic grain blight on Earth, leading to 75 years of rough independent life for the colonists. The 1st edition rule system is a semi-complex percentile skill-based system. The 2nd edition has a completely new system which uses dice pools: roll d10's equal to your aptitude (1 to 3), take the lowest roll, and try to get less than your attribute+skill+modifiers. In both, character creation is semi-random attributes and point-bought skills.",

Each die has icons such as \"Universal Success\", \"Physical Success\", \"Mental Success\", \"Universal Hindrance\", \"Damage\", and many icons for skills, magic, and special circumstances. Action resolution is by rolling your set of dice and counting applicable success icons, compared to the result of Challenge dice (if unopposed) or the opposed entity's dice (if opposed). Challenge dice have 2 out of 6 faces as \"Null\" which cancels one success. Character creation is open point-based of a sort: the player chooses icons for his four starting dice.

Character creation is by picking a race and culture (which modify attitudes from their base of 2), distributing some flexible points for skills and raising attitudes, and then picking 3 trade ranks from the 37 trades. Tasks are resolved by rolling a number of d6 equal to your skill level, taking the highest and adding the appropriate attribute to compare against the difficulty. In action scenes, dice are split between an action pool and reaction pool -- which are refreshed according to the character's trade scores.",

Character creation uses classes such as fighters, wizards, and other common types. Characters may include Portuguese bandeirantes, native scouts, miracle-working Jesuits, native shamans, Yoruba medium-priests, and even Hermetic European \"warlocks\". Combat is resolved using 2d10 + weapon or dodge skill, while non-combat tasks are resolved using 1d100 roll under skill. (It uses d20, d10 and d6.) The game includes a number of monsters including native beasts such as the anhang√ºera (demon-possessed fire-breathing animals), kana√≠ma (cannibals reincarnated as werejaguars) and jurupari (nightmare spirits who strangle people in their sleep), as well as more prosaic fare -- vampires, werewolves, mermaids and even the Devil itself. There are at least three sourcebooks: \"A Floresta do Medo/O Engenho\" (two adventures); \"Os Quliombos da Lua\" (setting expansion, detailing a fortress deep in the wilderness built by rebel african slaves); and \"O Vale dos Acrit√≥s\" (detailing the region of the savage giant native Acrit√≥s and their culture).",

Character creation is by choosing a class (which gives a package of basic skills), then adding points for advantages and skill modifications. The base system is for unrealistic cross-genre in-Park \"game-play\"... where medieval knights fight gun-toting cyberpunks on semi-even footing.",

In combat, a hit roll is by a roll modified by targets avoid percentage -- followed by hit location and damage (using d6s) upon success. Character creation is a mix of random-roll and point-buy, where skill points can be used to modify the results of random rolls for race, social class, handedness, and attributes.

The game uses a Director/GM role as well as a special role for Mara's spirit, along with player roles for up to six of Mara's immediate family. Character creation includes picking one of six relationship types (devoted/ competitive/ respectful/ bitter/ subordinate/ detached), as well as picking a personal grief or regret of the player to bring into the game. The moment that a character lets go of their regret for Mara, the player gives an out-of-character soliloquy about that grief or regret while placing a flower on the grave.

      "description": "A GMless storytelling game about humans plagued by Faeries, with no defined human setting - ranging from traditonal fairy tales to modern-day urban fantasy and beyond. Each player creates a human and also a Fae, and each player's Fae must connect to another player's human. Play proceeds in scenes, where there is a defined spotlight character whose success in the scene is determined by bidding dice (d6s). Players spend dice to get what they want, and get dice by giving control to the Fae (aka \"geis\"). Geis are phrased as compulsions and abstentions that the character must follow. Human character creation is by defining four Elements (Head, Heart, Life, and Loins), at least 2 Goals, and 6 Supports (i.e. things important to the character). Fae creation is by answering three questions: \"Who are you?\", \"What do you want?\" and \"What makes you weak?\"",

Character creation is limited point-based: distribute 30 points among 12 attributes, and 30 points among skills and advantages. The second edition uses the \"Tri-Stat\" system from Big Eyes, Small Mouth. The third edition uses a step die system, where you add attribute number plus skill number plus a die roll versus a fixed difficulty of 9. The die rolled varies with difficulty, from a d20 for easy tasks to a d4 for nearly impossible ones. Third edition character creation is limited point-based, with 14 attribute points and 9 occupation points. Occupations vary in cost based on breadth, and have three ranks (Rookie, Professional, and Veteran).",

After a successful roll, it is reset to 2. Character creation is class-based, including classes such as Big Dumb Imps, Smart Imps, Devious Imps, and Crazy Imps. Successful missions or quests can earn \"Praise Points\" from the Imp's master. The Imps can use Praise Points between sessions to purchase new traits and abilities, which range from firebreathing to kleptomania and pacifism.",

The game had three related combat systems: jousting, hand-to-hand, and melee. Combat resolution worked by both players secretly selecting one of 10 maneuver cards. Comparing cards gave a target number to hit on 1d100, where the figure with higher Prowess adds the difference to his roll. Damage is based on the action and the difference between the roll and target. The game also included a description of the code of chivalry, some encounter tables, and rules for falling in love.

It is designed for a single, short session with 2-8 players - with included rules based on the free rule system Archipelago II, by Matthijs Holter. There is a Guide with no main character and a pre-determined sequence of ten scenes. In each scene, players take turns narrating what happens. The current narrator may use mechanics to draw from three sets of custom cards: Fate cards, Setting Element cards, and Resolution cards. The scenario is Warsaw in 1939 on the eve of the German encirclement- with players taking the roles of people on the very last train out of the city: the Conductor, the Quiet Man, the Engineer, the Fireman, the Adjutant, the Countess, the Old Man, and the Pretty Girl.",

It uses a d6-based rules system, where action resolution is skill plus 2d6 vs difficulty (with some complications for combat).

Each hero represents a single being from legend: a God like Thor or Athena; an Angel like Michael or Gabriel; a Hero like Hercules; or a Monster like Fenrir or a Spriggan. The setting is described, but the true reasons behind the event are left up to the group. It uses a dice-pool system, rolling a number of d6's based on skill + modifiers, where any result of 4-6 indicates a success. Character creation is limited-point based (spending points on Attributes, Skills, and Advantages) plus a selection of template, i.e. a pre-define mythic source which provides your powers. The core rulebook includes Greek, Norse, Celtic, and Angelic sources, plus there is a supplement for Aztec, Maya, Sumerian and Babylonian sources.",

It uses a resolution system based on playing cards, where hands of cards are played off against each other one at a time. Character creation begins picking one of 10 character types (including Politician, War veteran, Journalist, Gangster) and one of 10 attributes (including Paranoid, Depressed, Idealistic, Hardboiled). The player then decides upon their character's life goal (what they hope to achieve before they die). The GM then chooses who each character's enemy is, and introduces the femme fatale, the one woman each player wants, but only one can have.",

Players then choose two freeform attributes assigned a d6 and a d10 as well as a single-word d20 trait. After character creation, players and GM collectively create the setting by drawing a map and marking it with each character's d20 trait and adding features related to these. Play proceeds by scenes that the GM creates and the players add details to. Resolution is by taking the highest result of rolling all dice that apply, compared to a difficulty (default 4) or opposed roll. Foregoing a d20 roll can earn the player a reroll token.",

      "description": "An urban fantasy game where the player characters are humans who were once mortal, but received the Spark that transformed them into minor deities. Each god has a Dominion - i.e. what they are a god of - as well as specialized skills within that subject, called Manifestations. They also become connected to a territory that is influenced by the Dominion. So a goddess of liquor would have a territory that developed more alcoholics. The gods are divided into \"Theologies\" - widespread groups sharing a purpose or theme, such as the Ascendants who want to become as powerful as the old gods, or the Cult of the Saints who believe they were sent from Heaven. They also form into local pantheons, who have shared or overlapping territory. Resolution uses a simplified variant of the \"Dynamic Gaming System\" from from Apocalypse Prevention, Inc. by the same author. The core mechanic is 1d20 + Attribute + Skill vs. a Target Number of 10, 20, 30, or 40. Characters creation is limited point-based, including both human stats (25 points in six attributes and 25+IQ points in skills) as well as godly stats.",

There are no classes or levels. Rather, character creation is template-based. All characters must choose one culture (Arab, Asian, Easterner, frontiersman, native or Westerner) and one caste, their social class (slave, servant, freeman, bourgeois, noble or royal). Advancement is by \"creative energy points\", which are used to buy new advantages. There is no combat bonus. Rather, there is a Combat skill, with three sub-skills: Attack, Defend, and Initiative. Damage is done by the difference between attack roll and defense roll, modified by weapon and armor. It also includes \"plot points\" which can be spent to control narration.",

Combat has options for escalation and increased consequences. In character generation, players answer a series of questions by choosing from lists of options, which generates a small collection of statistics for sins, suffering, ambitions and gear.

Play is largely freeform, using a set of scribbled notes and a board containing nine fields that an object is moved between.

After that, two scenes for each player are played, dealing with childhood and adolescence to complete the characters.

It uses a GMless system using playing cards. Each game begins at the secret Grand Lodge of the Americas, where the characters recieve a coded message about British movements. The players draw 5 cards and read their meaning on a series of table as an adventure starter. They then pick from pregenerated characters of Founding Fathers such as George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, and Benjamin Franklin - with one player taking the Tories. Each turn, a player lays down cards from their hand and begins to narrate a scene - limited by the card suit that specifies type of action. Other players can play cards to add to or alter that narrative.",

The core rulbook is staple-bound with only a large purple gas giant and space background on the cover, and no interior illustrations. The rules are split into a \"Basic Game\" using pre-generated characters from the series, and an \"Advanced Game\" with full character creation and additional combat rules like random initiative. Characters have six attributes (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Charisma, Luck, and Mentality) generated by 3d6 rolls modified by race. There is a \"Hand-to-Hand Class\" bonus, but no other skills and no experience rules. Melee combat is resolved in a single damage step. The attacker rolls 1d6-6d6 (depending on weapon) plus Strength, Dexterity, and Hand-to-Hand Class modifiers. The defender subtracts 1d6 plus Luck and Hand-to-Hand Class modifiers from this total to determine damage. Ranged combat requires a 1d6 roll under a hit number which depends on range and the attacker's Dexterity. The rules include sheets for bridge crew including Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Uhura, Checkov, Sulu, Chapel, and Scott as well as M'res and Arex from the Star Trek animated series. The advanced rules include descriptions of several alien races including Larry Niven's Kzin, an extensive equipment list, tables for randomly-generated aliens, and two introductory scenarios.

      "description": "A dark future science fiction RPG, set in the year 2136 where the U.N. and corporations have fostered a society aimed at creating ultimate opponents and warriors through an adversarial system. It uses a percentile skill system where every skill and attribute roll is an opposed roll, where you subtract a percentile roll from modified skill level to determine the effectiveness (EF) of the attempt. The EF is compared to an opposed roll to see if they succeed. This may be modified by a related skill roll (\"tweaking\") or spending a limited number of luck points. Characters are created by a random-roll class-based system. The player rolls for the race of the character, where the races are different genetically engineered versions of humanity. Primary attributes are then generated with dice rolls based on the race. The player then rolls education level based on a chart, and chooses a profession from 5 options: Special Tactics Officer (STO), Corporate Spy (C-Spy), Nano-Tech, Med-Tech and Psi-Tech. Skills are then bought with points based on education level and profession. There are two types of skills: main skills (worth 5 points per level) and sub-skills, which are multipliers of the main skill total. It also has a personality system where characters have defined \"passions\" that trigger possible disillusionment with the social order (i.e. \"A civilian is about to be killed - do I save them and lose the plans?\"). Triggered attitude checks may make the character more disillusioned with the system, making it harder go up ranks and get new technology but granting an experience bonus. Besides the game system book, the core game also has a Tech Manual (covering various equipment) and The Defense Zone Manual (GM's guide).",

It is an open secret that the office run by transcendental artificial intelligences spread throughout time, who are trying to save humanity to ease their loneliness. Character creation is by rating four player-chosen core values (rated 0-10) representing what they believe in, and also Capabilities (rated 1-10) representing the five kinds of technology built into their bodies (rated 1-10): Biotech, Cognitech, Metatech, Nanotech, and Stringtech. Higher ratings in Capabilities result in greater complications and fewer levels in the story-level abilities -- the six Themes: Plot Immunity, Intrigue, Empathy, Magnetism, Comprehension, and Romance. The player spends from 5 to 9 levels among the Themes. The player also spends points up to two times (Biotech plus Cognitech) among professions (i.e. broad skills). Resolution is by multiplying Capability and a 1d10 roll, and also Profession and a 1d10 roll, taking the higher result. A relevant Core Value adds +1 or +2 to the roll. Players may spend one Twist per session to activate a Theme, with an effect depending on the Theme type and level. More Twists can be gained by taking Complications.",

Action resolution is by drawing a number of cards equal to the appropriate trait, and taking the highest. The GM draws cards either based on task difficulty (1 to 10) or based on NPC stat. Each failure on a player's part adds a grievance, and if grievances are greater than the Essence stat, the character is effectively out of the scene. Flair can be gained by good descriptions, and creates a pool of points which can be spent to hold onto a high card for later use, or move the game to a chosen scene.

There are two teams of players: prosecution and defense. Character creation begins by distributing 18 points among six attributes: Authority, Jibe, Charm, Investigation, Violence, and Composure. They then pick two +1 traits, one +2 trait, one merit and one flaw. Player characters then choose teams and create a defendant by a series of random rolls for sex, age, and profession. Play follows with an explicit order of play for the arrest and court case. Actions can include legal maneuvers as well as assaulting an opponent, intimidating witnesses, seducing key figures, and more. Core resolution is by rolling 1d6 and adding stats and special bonuses, compared to a difficulty or opposed roll - called the \"Beer and Crisps\" system.",

Advancement is level-based, with all classes going up to 600th level. Characters can have \"tenths\", where each tenth reduces damage by 1/10 (i.e. two tenths means the character takes 1/100 damage).",

Magic has always existed in our world, though mostly hidden because it has backed oppressed classes such as poor blacks and Latinos. Magic has recently gained press and publicity during the rise of rap and hip-hop, as the gang slingers became popular and brought their knowledge of the streets and magic to a broader audience. Character creation uses freeform Traits, two positive and two negative, to indicate things your character is good at or bad at. You are given a broad-range Skill to cover things your character has proficiency in. You have at least one Ally, one Enemy, one Lover, and one Rival. Action resolution is based on 3d6, plus extra dice for traits. The player rolls and keeps the highest three (for positive traits) or lowest three (for negative traits). The dice are then assigned to three categories: Order (how fast you execute, i.e. initiative), Power (how effective you are at achieving your goal), and Payback (a gift from the Wyrd, giving benefits such as healing, not being damaged in the first place, more success on your next magical action, or a nifty magical effect on your next mundane action).",
